        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I'm an undergrad at Carnegie Mellon doubling in Electrical and 
          Computer Engineering and Computer Science. 
          I'm heading to Microsoft next year to work on the Transmedia team 
          (Xbox platform stuff).

          Math is really great and I am constantly reminded about how much I
          like it during class (the words "I love math" pop up pretty much every
          time I learn a cool proof). I'm ~one semester away from graduating, 
          and I'm terrified about what kind of person I'll be without school to
          keep me straight. Here's to optimism...
